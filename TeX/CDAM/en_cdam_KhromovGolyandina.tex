\section{Introduction}

Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is one of the methods used for time
series analysis~\cite{Golyandina2001}, in which the original time
series is transformed into a matrix, called the trajectory matrix,
using a given window length $L$. The singular value decomposition
(SVD) of this matrix is then analyzed. When the objective is to
estimate the signal and its properties from an observed noisy series,
the first $r$ components of the SVD are considered, where $r$ is the
rank of the signal trajectory matrix. Based on the selected
components, the signal estimation is constructed. A distinctive
feature of the method is that it does not require the specification
of a signal model. However, SSA can also handle a parametric signal
model in the form of a sum of products of polynomials, exponentials
and sinusoids. The frequency estimation problem plays a special role.
The ESPRIT method uses the estimation of the signal subspace based on
the $r$ leading left singular vectors of the trajectory matrix SVD to
estimate the frequencies present in the signal.
The least squares (LS) version of ESPRIT~\cite{Roy1989} is also known
as Hankel SVD (HSVD), and the total least squares (TLS) version is
known as HTLS~\cite{VanHuffel1994}.

A number of works propose tensor modifications of the SSA and ESPRIT
methods, where the original series is transformed into a tensor,
usually of 3rd order, instead of a
matrix~\cite{DeLathauwer2011,Papy2005,Trung2024}.  One of the common
variants of tensor decompositions is Higher-Order SVD (HO-SVD), which
generalizes the matrix SVD.

This work aims to compare the performance of matrix and tensor
modifications of SSA in solving signal extraction and frequency
estimation problems. We will consider the tensor modifications
proposed in~\cite{Papy2005} and~\cite{Papy2009},  which have been
adapted for signal extraction.

\section{Methods description}
\subsection{Tensor SSA algorithm layout for signal extraction}
The general structure of tensor SSA algorithms based on HO-SVD is as
follows (Basic SSA is a special case). Let $\tX$ be the observed
object. The tensor dimensions $I$, $L$ and $K$ are considered as the
window length; some of these dimensions are expressed in terms of the
others, or are fixed. The parameters of the algorithm are the values
$R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$. These are often chosen to be equal to $r$,
but not always.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Embedding to the trajectory tensor $\bfX = \calT(\tX)$.
  \item
    Tensor decomposition $\bfX =\sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{l=1}^{J} \sum_{k=1}^{K}
    \mathcal{Z}_{ilk} U^{(1)}_{i}
    \circ U^{(2)}_{l} \circ U^{(3)}_{k}$.
  \item
    Grouping $\hat\bfX =\sum_{i=1}^{R_1} \sum_{l=1}^{R_2} \sum_{k=1}^{R_3}
    \mathcal{Z}_{ilk} U^{(1)}_{i}
    \circ U^{(2)}_{l} \circ U^{(3)}_{k}$.
  \item
    Obtaining from $\hat\bfX$ the signal estimate $\hat\tX$ based on
    the structure of the trajectory tensor and the operation that is
    inversed  to embedding.
\end{enumerate}

We will further consider two types of input object: single-channel
and multi-channel time series.

\subsection{Trajectory tensors}
Let $\tX = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N)$ be a single-channel time series
of length $N$, $x_n \in \mathbb{C}$.
\begin{definition}
  The tensor embedding operator for a single-channel time series with
  window lengths $I$ and $L$ (then $K=N-I-L+2$) such that ${1< I,L <
  N},\, {I + L < N + 1}$
  is a mapping $\calT_{I,L}$ that transfers the series
  $\tX$ into the tensor $\calX \in \mathbb{C}^{I\times L \times K}$
  as follows: ${\mathcal{X}_{ilk}=x_{i+l+k-2}}$, where
  $i\in \overline{1:I},\, l \in\overline{1:L},\, k \in\overline{1:K}$.
\end{definition}

Let $\tX = \left(\tX^{(1)}, \tX^{(2)}, \ldots, \tX^{(P)}\right)$ be a
multi-channel
time series consisting of $P$ single-channel series, also called channels.
\begin{definition}
  The tensor embedding operator for a multi-channel time series with
  window length $L$ (that is, $I=P$, $L$, $K=N-L+1$) such that ${1< L
  < N}$ is a mapping $\calT_{L}$
  that translates the
  $P$-channel time-series $\tX$ into the tensor $\calX \in
  \mathbb{C}^{P \times L \times K}$ as follows
  $\mathcal{X}_{plk} =  x_{l+k-1}^{(p)}$, where ${{p \in
    \overline{1:P}},\, l \in
  \overline{1:L}},\, {k \in \overline{1:K}}$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Algorithm for signal parameters estimation}
Consider the $P$-channel time series (including the single-channel case
$P=1$) with elements
\begin{gather*}
  x_n^{(p)}= \sum_{r=1}^{R} a_r^{(p)} e^{\alpha_r n} e^{\iu\left(2\pi
  \omega_r n + \varphi_r^{(p)}\right)},
\end{gather*}
where the model parameters are the amplitudes $a_r^{(p)} \in
\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$, phases ${\varphi_r^{(p)} \in [0, 2\pi)}$,
the frequencies $\omega_r\in [0, 1/2]$, and the damping factors $\alpha_r \in
\mathbb{R}$. The HO-ESPRIT algorithm that estimates the frequencies
and damping factors of a time series is defined as follows.
After the embedding step the matrix $\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{U}_d =
\left[U_1^{(d)} :
U_2^{(d)}:\ldots : U_{R_d}^{(d)}\right]$ for $d\in \{1, 2,
3\}$ is constructed and the following matrix equation
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{U}^{\uparrow}=\mathbf{U}_{\downarrow}\mathbf{Z}
\end{equation*}
is solved with respect to matrix $\mathbf{Z}$, where the up and down
arrows placed
behind the matrix $\mathbf{U}$ stand for deleting its first and last
rows accordingly.
The $R$ largest eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{Z}$ are considered
to be the estimates of the poles $\lambda_r = e^{\alpha_r + 2\pi\iu
\omega_r}$, from which the parameters $\alpha_r$ and $\omega_r$ can be obtained.

\subsection{Dstack modifications}
In the paper~\cite{Papy2009}, to improve the speed of the method, it
is proposed to transform a single-channel series into a multi-channel
series before applying the tensor modification: $x_m^{(d)} =
x_{(m-1)D + d}$, where $m \in \overline{1:(N/D)}$. In that paper only
the ESPRIT modification called HTLSDstack is considered, but we will
apply this time series transformation for the signal estimation
problem as well, and will call the resulting method SSADstack.
Tensor modifications are constructed as for a multi-channel series.

\section{Comparison of tensor and matrix methods}
All numerical comparisons are made using time series that are
expressed as sums of sinusoids.

The following methods were compared for single channel time series
and signal extraction problem: SSA, HO-SSA, SSADstack, HO-SSADstack
with $R_1=r$ and HO-SSADstack with $R_1=1$. It has been shown that,
in most cases, the SSA method significantly outperforms other methods
in terms of accuracy. When the SSA method is less accurate, the
difference is negligible and only occurs for a very narrow range of
parameters. This minor disadvantage is therefore not a practical
consideration. Of the Dstack methods, SSADstack and HO-SSADstack are
the most accurate, with a small difference in accuracy when $R_1=r$.

For single-channel time series and frequency estimation problem, a
signal in the form of two sinusoids with close frequencies was
considered. The ESPRIT, HO-ESPRIT, HTLSDstack, HO-HTLSDstack with
$R_1=r$ and HO-HTLSDstack with $R_1=1$ methods were compared. It was
found that ESPRIT performs more accurately at a low noise level.
However, at a medium or high noise level, HO-ESPRIT with optimal
parameter selection becomes more accurate. Furthermore, HO-HTLSDstack
with $R_1=1$ outperforms all methods.

For multi-channel time series, it has been demonstrated that, when
all channels are expressed as a sum of sinusoids with equal
frequencies, tensor modifications provide more accurate results for
both signal extraction and frequency estimation.

\section{Conclusions}
Numerical comparisons revealed the varying effects of the HO-SVD
tensor modifications on different time series problems. For signal
extraction from a single-channel time series, the basic matrix method
is certainly more accurate. However, for multi-channel time series
with an equal set of frequencies across the channels, and for
frequency estimation problems, the tensor methods can offer improved accuracy.
